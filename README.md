# MATLAB-MSc-Code
This is the code I authored for my MSc dissertation on the inhibition of Laccase by halides and metal ions in an enzymatic wastewater treatment process under real-world conditions.

The code could be useful to people who wish to extract data from the UK's Environment Agency (abbreviated EA) [water quality datasets](https://environment.data.gov.uk/water-quality/view/download/new).
